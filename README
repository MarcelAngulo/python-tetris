Thank user for looking at my first programming project: Tetris Game

All the source code is contained in "main.py"

For setting up the game, you must install the libraries listed at "requirements.txt": pygame and numpy at the moment
Next you must unzip "Bebas_Neue.zip" to get "BebasNeue-Regular.ttf" which the game uses to render text.

That's all. Run "main.py" and enjoy! ;)
